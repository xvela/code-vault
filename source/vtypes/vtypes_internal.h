/**
This helper class is used internally to wrap POSIX file APIs needed by our low-level
implementation, while handling thread interruption errors and retrying. We also redefine
the path parameters as VString instead of const char*, so that we can pass them through
to VPlatformAPI low level functions (on Windows these need to denormalize the path string
and widen it to UTF-16 for use with Win32 wide string APIs that can handle Unicode; contrast
with Unix/Mac which can take our existing UTF-8 char strings).

VPlatformAPI defines the lower level APIs for interfacing directly with the platform's
file system API which deal in paths. These APIs take UTF-8 formatted VString paths.
The implementation is platform-specific:
- Unix and Mac can just call the matching vault:: namespace function.
- Windows must denormalize the path and then widen it to UTF-16 to pass to the corresponding Win32 "wide" API.
These functions are to be called by the corresponding VFileSystem functions.
